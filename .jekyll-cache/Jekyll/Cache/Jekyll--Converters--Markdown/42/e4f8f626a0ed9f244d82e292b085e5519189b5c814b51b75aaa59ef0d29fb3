I"[<p>Welcome Disney planners! In this article we are going to discuss Disney Dinning and everything you need to do to grab the best dinning spots at the best times - all for the UK visitor.</p>

<p>Walt Disney World (WDW) has over 200 restaurants so there are plenty to choose from, with around 90 being located in a theme park. They are split into 3 main categories Quick Service (QS), Table Service (TS) and Signature</p>

<h2 id="quick-service">Quick Service</h2>
<p>This is your basic dinning location which is a counter service (you order and walk up to a counter to collect then find a seat somewhere). A lot of people think this is just your standard burger and chips (and there are a lot of those) but you can find some really great locations as well (I love Flame Tree BBQ over in AK).</p>
